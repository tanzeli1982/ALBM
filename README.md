# Advanced Lake Biogeochemistry Model

**Advanced Lake Biogeochemistry Model (ALBM)** is a one-dimensional process-based lake biogeochemistry model that was developed by Zeli Tan to predict the response of lake thermal and carbon dynamics and water quality to environmental changes (`Tan et al., 2015, 2017, 2018`). It consists of several modules including those for the radiative transfer, the water/sediment thermal circulation, the water/sediment biogeochemistry, phytoplankton biomass, and the gas diffusive and ebullition transportation. Although the model was originally developed for Arctic lakes (`Tan et al., 2015`), it has since been used for lakes in diverse environments (`Guseva et al., 2020; Guo et al., 2020, 2021`). ALBM is a member model of the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISIMIP) lake sector (https://www.isimip.org/impactmodels/details/232/). Please find the model use guidence in [ALBM User Manual.pdf](https://github.com/tanzeli1982/ALBM/blob/master/ALBM%20User%20Manual.pdf). Input data are available from https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.22635064. The new CH4 model code is available at https://github.com/tanzeli1982/ALBM/tree/CH4_new.
